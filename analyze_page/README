1. In the site of www.shopping.com, the number of products is not always 40. 
   Sometimes, in the first page, the number of products is 41, and sometimes, 
   it is 38. So in order to get the total number of products in a search, we 
   need to get the number of products in every page and sum them up.
   As in every page, every product has a identifier of "quickLookItem-#", we 
   can count the number of "quickLookItem-#" to get the number of products in
   a page.

2. In every page, we can get the information of the product by analyzing the 
   content of the current html page.
   For example,
   we can get the price from the "itemPrice" field,
   we can get the vendor from the "newMerchantName" field,
   we can get the title from the "quickLookGridItemFullName" filed,
   we can get the shipping price from the "taxShippingArea" field.
